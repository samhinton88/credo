Hi <%- name %>!

This is a template, it's built using a library called Embedded JS (EJS).

This means that I can pass the data you're inputing and include it in this text.

This page is powered by the repository you forked from Credo.

You could show this working by pushing a change in this file, either in github or locally:

<% if (developerType === 'frontend') { %>
When I first learned to code I really looked down on Frontend development,
now it's basically all that I do
<% } %>
